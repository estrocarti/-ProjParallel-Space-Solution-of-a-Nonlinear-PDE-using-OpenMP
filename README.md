Parallel Space Solution of a Nonlinear PDE using OpenMP

This project focuses on the parallel solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) using OpenMP, a widely used API for shared-memory parallel programming. It explores how to efficiently solve PDEs that describe complex physical phenomena by leveraging the power of multi-core processors. The project employs numerical methods, such as finite difference or finite element methods, to discretize the PDE in space and then solves it iteratively, optimizing the solution process through parallelism.
Key Features:

    Nonlinear PDE Solvers: Implements algorithms to solve a nonlinear PDE, which may represent phenomena such as heat transfer, fluid dynamics, or wave propagation. Nonlinearities are handled using techniques like Newton's method for solving nonlinear systems.
    OpenMP Parallelization: Utilizes OpenMP directives to parallelize the solution process, specifically targeting loops and iterative methods to speed up the computation. The project focuses on optimizing the parallel performance by dividing the problem domain into smaller subdomains, allowing multiple threads to compute in parallel.
    Space Discretization: Discretizes the PDE in space using methods like finite differences or finite elements, breaking down the continuous problem into a grid that can be handled in parallel.
    Efficient Parallel Communication: Ensures minimal synchronization overhead and efficient data sharing across threads, using OpenMP constructs such as private, shared, and reduction variables to manage memory access and avoid race conditions.
    Scalability and Performance Analysis: Measures the scalability of the parallel solution by running simulations on different numbers of threads and analyzing how the performance scales with increasing grid size. Speedup, efficiency, and load balancing are key metrics explored in this project.
    Numerical Stability and Convergence: Incorporates checks for the stability and convergence of the solution, particularly when solving nonlinear PDEs, ensuring the correctness and robustness of the numerical method.
